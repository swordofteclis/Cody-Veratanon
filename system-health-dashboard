### Project 3: `system-health-dashboard`

**What it is:**  
A simple web dashboard (Flask or FastAPI) that monitors system metrics (CPU, RAM, disk, maybe ping latency to critical hosts) and shows them in a browser.

**Why it helps SEO / reputation:**

- Positions you as someone who can build **systems monitoring**, **DevOps-ish dashboards**, and basic **web backends**.
- Keywords like **“system health monitoring,” “observability,” “Python dashboard”**.

**Suggested README:**

```markdown
# System Health Dashboard
