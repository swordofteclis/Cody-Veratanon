# 👋 Hi, I'm Cody Veratanon

I'm a Systems Engineer and Cybersecurity professional with experience in RF systems, dataflow engineering, and DoD-level cyber defense. I focus on building reliable, secure, and high-performance systems that support mission-critical operations.

My background includes:
-- 🛰️ RF & satellite communications
- 🔐 Cyber defense operations & network security
- 🧪 Test engineering, automation, and data analysis (Python)
- Engineering experience with **RF test setups**, Keysight PNAs, high-speed digitizers, and neural-network-based signal classification
- Systems integration & automation across Linux, Python, MATLAB, and NiFi environments
- Professional interests in **signal analysis**, **fault-detection automation**, **systems engineering**, and **secure infrastructure design**

## 🌐 Professional Focus
I enjoy creating tools, automations, and analytics that help engineers diagnose system issues faster. My recent work includes:
- Automated RF component fault detection using **machine learning**
- System performance analysis and cable-loss measurement tools
- Custom switch-matrix configuration scripts
- Secure systems integration for defense and aerospace environments

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, SQL, Bash, MATLAB  
**Specialty Areas:** RF systems, dataflow engineering, cyber defense  
**Tools:** Git, Docker, Kubernetes (beginner), Keysight PNA, Alazar ATS-9416, NiFi, Linux  

## 📁 Featured Projects
### 🔹 RF Component Health Classifier (Python + ML)
A machine-learning model trained to identify subtle RF degradation patterns from S-parameter sweeps.

### 🔹 Cable Loss Analyzer
Python tool that automates calibration and sweeping of RF lines from 0–15 GHz for cryogenic systems.

### 🔹 Automated Switch-Matrix Builder
Generates custom wiring layouts from user input to accelerate system assembly.
